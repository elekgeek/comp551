tree_navigation.c is a crude implementation of the PS03 tree navigation algorithm.
It initializes the neighbor system and uses the broadcastMsgUpdateLeaderElection function to find the root node.
The robot indicates the number of hops away from the root it is by illuminating the leds.
All of the leds flash in a circular pattern if a robot is the root.
By pushing the blue led button, the robot will navigate to the root node using the behMoveToNbr function.
The movement is not perfect so the robot may stop prematurely or run into the root node.
